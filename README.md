# TeV_Halo_Self_Confinement

There are two codes that are included here, one is a 1D particle transport code, and the 2nd is a spherically symmetric 3D particle transport code. The differences are in the r^2 volume factor of the 3D code, which causes the CR gradient to fall off quicker.

There are many options that can be set within the code, both through command line arguments and through switchable options within the code.
